# Redis Cache Project

This is a demonstration application showcasing the use of Redis for caching API responses. This project implements caching for GET requests to improve performance and reduce load on the server.

## Description

This application uses Redis to cache the responses of GET API requests. By implementing caching, it reduces the time required to serve repeated requests for the same data and decreases the load on the backend services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Redis server (make sure Redis is installed and running)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivrajkhetri7/redis_cache.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd redis_cache
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (if needed) for configuration settings.

## API Endpoints

This application provides the following API endpoints:

### 1. GET Request with Caching

- **Endpoint**: `/api/data` (or your specific endpoint)
- **Method**: GET

- **Description**: Fetches data and caches the result in Redis. If the data is already cached, it retrieves it from Redis instead of hitting the database.

- **Response**:
  - **Success**:

    ```json
    {
        "data": []
    }
    ```

  - **Error**:

    ```json
    {
        "error": "An error message"
    }
    ```

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

For development mode with automatic restarts on file changes, use:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Ensure that your Redis server is running before starting the application.

## Scripts

- **`npm start`**: Starts the application in production mode.
- **`npm run start:dev`**: Starts the application in development mode with `nodemon`.
